# Cooling-Stage
Our lab built a new cooling stage and associated immobilization protocol 
for strong immobilization of C. elegans on their original cultivation plate.
Despite its profound impact on biology, most high-resolution in vivo microscopy
approaches remain low throughput because current immobilization techniques 
require significant manual effort. We greatly accelerate imaging of the nematode
Caenorhabditis elegans by implementing a simple cooling approach to easily 
immobilize entire populations directly on their cultivation plates. We optimize
and characterize cooling immobilization. Counterintuitively, relatively warmer 
temperatures immobilize animals significantly more effectively than colder 
temperatures utilized in prior studies. This enhanced immobilization enables 
clear submicron-resolution fluorescence imaging, which is challenging to achieve
with most current immobilization techniques. We demonstrate 64Ã— magnification 3D
imaging and timelapse recording of neurons in adults and embryos without motion 
blur. Compared to standard azide immobilization, cooling immobilization reduces 
the animal preparation and recovery time by >98%, significantly increasing 
experimental speed. By obviating individual animal manipulation, our approach 
could also empower automated imaging of large C. elegans populations within 
standard experimental setups and workflows.
